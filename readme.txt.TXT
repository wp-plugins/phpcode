Write PHP code in your posts, which will be syntax-highlighted automatically

== Description ==

After unsuccessfully looking for over 2 hours for a suitable Wordpress-Plugin, which allows me to post
syntax-highlighted PHP-Code into Wordpress, I deceided to write my own small wordpress plugin, which enables
me to post my small PHP Code snippets. Basically it is intended for posting small, colored (syntax highlighted)
PHP code into your Wordpress posts. For me, it’s working, at least for my own purposes. The plugin is using the
same colors like the PHP-internal Syntaxhighlighter.

== Installation ==


1. Upload `phpcode.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Just put your php code in your posts inside of <phpcode></phpcode> tags to get syntax highlighted code
